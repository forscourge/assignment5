In case your scanner and parser do not work properly, you can use the class
files in this subdirectory instead with Assignment 5. The provided classfiles
are Scanner.class, Parser.class and MiniC.class. You must use *all* classfiles,
otherwise scanner and parser wonâ€™t work.  If you use the provided classfiles,
you must remove Scanner.java, Parser.java and MiniC.java from the sources
listed in the MiniC Makefile. You should rename any existing Scanner.java,
Parser.java and MiniC.java file to end in another filename extension, e.g.,
*.java.old, to prevent them from being picked up by the compiler.
