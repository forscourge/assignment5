In case your scanner does not work properly, you can use the class files in
this subdirectory instead with Assignment 5. The provided classfiles are
Scanner.class and MiniC.class. You must use *both* classfiles, otherwise the
scanner won’t work.  If you use the provided classfiles, you must remove
Scanner.java and MiniC.java from the sources listed in the MiniC Makefile. You
should rename any existing Scanner.java and MiniC.java file to end in another
filename extension, e.g., Scanner.java.old and MiniC.java.old, to prevent them
from being picked up by the compiler.
